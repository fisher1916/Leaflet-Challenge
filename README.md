# USGS Earthquake Mapping

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive data visualization of earthquakes that occurred 
worldwide. Data is collected from [United States Geological Survey](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), drawing on a revolving 7-day significant earthquake (4.5 and greater magnitude) dataset. In addition, options are given to show the map with tetonic plates, and with different mapping topographies.
